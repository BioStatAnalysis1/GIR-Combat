GIR-Combat: Batch effect correction method for scRNA-seq data with large variance based on global information reference batches

## Overview
This repository contains the code for the paper "GIR-Combat: Batch effect correction method for scRNA-seq data with large variance based on global information reference batches".

## Regenerating the figures
1. The implementation of the code is based on R language.
2. All the R packages needed for the experiment are included in the code.
3. Our project consists of five experiments, three of which are simulation experiments and two are real data experiments. Each experiment is comprised of four .R files, named part1 to part4. For each experiment, in order to reproduce the results, you need to perform Parts 1 through 4 sequentially.
4. A Gaussian smoothing kernel function is implemented in dusmooth_gaussian_kernel.cpp, which is suitable for data analysis in R.
5. For each experiment:
   -part1 is used to
   -
